# OpenStreetMap Configuration
# OpenStreetMap integration uses Nominatim API and Leaflet maps
# No API key required for basic usage
# For production use, consider setting up your own Nominatim instance

# Development features
# Set to false to use real Nominatim API (https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org)
# Set to true to use mock data for development without API calls
REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_PLACES=false
REACT_APP_DEBUG_MODE=false

# Note: With REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_PLACES=true, you get:
# - Interactive Leaflet map with OpenStreetMap tiles
# - European landmark suggestions in autocomplete (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, Czech Republic)
# - No external API calls or rate limiting concerns
# - Perfect for development and demo purposes

# Note: OpenStreetMap and Nominatim are free to use but have usage policies:
# - Please respect the Nominatim usage policy: https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/
# - For heavy usage, set up your own Nominatim server or use a commercial service
